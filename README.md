# MyWebsite (My Personal Webpage with links to all platforms I am on)
Here is my first professional website with a nice layout, small about me and some links. The point of this webpage is to land some meaningful employment within the next year or so. I will continue to work on this site throughout my career. 

This website will solve the problem of a resume for a software engineer. Also it will be the best platform to showcase myself on one page. links will redirect everyone to other platforms to check me out, my work or what i contribute my money or time too. Enjoy the show!

# Running the website 
Nothing needs to be run to check out my webpage. 
Just take a look ! ---->
