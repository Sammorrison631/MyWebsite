# MyWebsite (My Personal Webpage with links to all platforms I am on)
Here is my first professional website with a nice layout, small about me and some links. The point of this webpage is to land some meaningful employment within the next year or so. I will be working on this site throughout my career. 
This website will showcase my skill of encryption through my resume. Links will redirect everyone to other platforms to check me out, my work or what i contribute my money or time too. Enjoy the show!
# Running the website
Nothing needs to be run to check out my webpage. Just, take a look! --->
